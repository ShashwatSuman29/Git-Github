**Step 4:** `git add .` (add all files present in the folder to git)<br>
**Step 5:** `git commit -m "commit message"` (commit the files)<br>
**Step 6:** `git branch -M main` (specify which branch to push code on)<br>

**Step 3:** Either click on Source Control (Ctrl + Shift + G) and clone the repo or open the terminal and write `git clone "link of the repo"`<br>

## What is Git?

- It is a version control system tool that helps to track changes in code.
- Git is a version control system.
- It is popular, free & open source, fast & scalable.

## What is GitHub?

- It is a website that allows developers to store and manage their code using Git.
- Code is stored here in the form of folders, which are called repositories.

## Commands in Git

- `git status`: Display the state of the code.
- Untracked: New files that Git doesn't yet track.
- Modified: Changed.
- Staged: File is ready to be committed.
- Unmodified: Unchanged.
- `git add` / `git add .`: Adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area.
- `git commit`: It is the record of changes.
- `git push`: Upload local repo content to remote (GitHub) repo.
- `git remote -v`: To verify which remote you are.
- `git branch`: To check branches.
- `git init`: Used to create a new Git repo.

## Branch Commands

- `git branch`: To check branches.
- `git branch -M main`: To rename a branch.
- `git checkout <branch name>`: To navigate or switch to a different branch.
- `git checkout -b <new branch name>`: To create a new branch.
- `git branch -d <branch name>`: To delete a branch.

## Merge Code

**Method 1:**

- `git diff <branch name>`: To compare commits, branches, files & more.
- `git merge <branch name>`: To merge two branches.

**Method 2:**

- Create a PR (pull request).

## What is Pull Request?

- It lets you tell others about changes you have pushed to a branch in a repo on GitHub.

## Pull Command

- `git pull origin main`: Used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update the local repo to match that content.

## Resolving Merge Conflicts

- An event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.

## Undoing Changes

**Case 1: Staged Changes**

- `git reset <filename>`
- `git reset` (to reset all changes)

**Case 2: Committed Changes (for one commit)**

- `git reset HEAD~1` (here HEAD means last commit)

**Case 3: Committed Changes (for many commits)**

- `git reset <commit hash>`
- `git reset --hard <commit hash>`

## Fork

- A fork is a new repo that shares code and visibility settings with the original upstream repo.
- It is a rough copy.

# Gist

- In GitHub, a Gist is a service that allows you to share snippets of code or text quickly and easily.


.Branching and Merging

1.Creating a Branch: Create a new branch:

    git checkout -b new-branch

2.Switching Branches: Switch to an existing branch:

    git checkout branch-name

3.Merging Branches: Merge a branch into your current branch:

    git merge branch-name

.Handling Merge Conflicts

* If there are conflicts during merging, Git will notify you. Resolve the conflicts, then:

    git add <file_with_conflicts>
    git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"

.Advanced Git Commands

1.Stashing Changes: Temporarily stash your changes:

    git stash

2.Applying Stashed Changes: Apply stashed changes:

    git stash apply

3.Rebasing Branches: Rebase your current branch onto another branch:

    git rebase branch-name

4.Resetting Commits: Reset your branch to a previous commit:

    git reset --hard commit-hash

.Collaborating on GitHub

1.Forking a Repository: Fork a repository to your GitHub account:
    * Go to the repository page on GitHub and click the "Fork"  button.

2.Creating Pull Requests: Create a pull request:

    1.Push your changes to a branch in your forked repository.
    2.Go to the original repository on GitHub.
    3.Click the "New pull request" button.
    4.Select the branch with your changes and follow the prompts to create the pull request.


# Force Push to Overwrite the Remote Repository
    -> Since you donâ€™t need the existing GitHub content, use this command:
       git push origin main --force
